## Project Overview
This report provides a broad overview for the percentage of adults experiencing _symptoms of anxiety and depression_ throughout the _phases of the coronavirus pandemic_. No matter the user, this report is to emphasize the mental health affects of covid by comparing the contribution of the different phases. Overall the mission is to bring awareness towards not only symptoms relating to anxiety and depression, but to bring awareness to mental health in general.

We have aimed to provide the user easy to understand graphs describing the relationship of coronavirus and symptoms of depression, anxiety or both combined through the _CDC's_ work. Along with this, the user is able to filter through the various phases to recognize the difference/similarity between each.

## What is our data?
Our chosen data set is from the _CDC_ and it contains information about mental health rates among US citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. The _US Census Bureau_ also assisted in the collection and organization of this data. The data was collected via an online survey where questions were asked about the frequency of anxiety and depression symptoms among adult respondents. This data set is available online for public view and was conducted to analyze the prevalence of heightened mental health issues during this trying time.  

The data can be found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/mental-health.htm).

## Who is our audience? 
Our target audience would be people who have struggled with mental
health issues through this pandemic. Although the data that we are looking at can be targeted to multiple groups of people, we think that targeting people who have suffered from these mental health disorders during the pandemic can feel some comfort in knowing they are not alone.

## What we want to learn?
- How did the percentage of adults who expressed anxiety or depression systems change throughout the pandemic?
- How did these changes vary by state?
- Did the changes in rates of anxiety and depression differ throughout the pandemic?
