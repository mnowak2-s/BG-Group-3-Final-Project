## What is our data?
Our chosen dataset is from the CDC and it contains information about mental health rates among US citizens during the coronavirus pandemic. This data was collected via an online survey, and questions were asked about level of anxiety and depression among respondents. This data set is available online for public view and was conducted to analyze the prevalence of heightened mental health issues during this trying time. The US Census Bureau also assisted in the collection and organization of this data.
